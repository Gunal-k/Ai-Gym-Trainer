## About The Project

This project aims to create a virtual fitness coach accessible to everyone. Using computer vision, it analyzes the user's movements to ensure exercises are performed correctly, reducing the risk of injury and maximizing workout effectiveness. Whether you're at home or in the gym, the AI Trainer is there to guide you.

This was built to [mention your motivation, e.g., "explore the applications of computer vision in fitness", "as a personal project to improve my Python skills", etc.].

## Features

- **Real-time Pose Estimation:** Tracks key body joints using your webcam.
- **Exercise Recognition:** Can identify specific exercises like [e.g., Squats, Push-ups, Bicep Curls].
- **Repetition Counting:** Automatically counts valid repetitions.
- **Form Correction Feedback:** Provides real-time alerts for common mistakes (e.g., "Keep your back straight!", "Go lower on your squat!").
- **[Add another feature you plan to implement]**

## Built With

This project is built with the following technologies and libraries.

* **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**
* **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)** - For camera feed and image processing.
* **[MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)** - For high-fidelity body pose tracking.
* **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)** - For numerical calculations.
* **[Add any other frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Streamlit, etc.]**

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd ai-gym-trainer
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required packages**
    *(First, create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal)*
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
