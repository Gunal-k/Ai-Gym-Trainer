# Examples: ignore a folder that is inside another folder

# # 1) Ignore the folder "secret" directly inside the repository root's "backend" folder
# /backend/secret/

# # 2) Ignore any "temp" folder anywhere under "src" (any depth)
# src/**/temp/

# # 3) Ignore any "cache" folder anywhere under "services"
# /services/**/cache/

# 4) Ignore a specific nested path exactly (root-anchored)
#/frontend/build/cache/   <-- uncomment and edit if needed

# 5) Ignore folder name regardless of location (all node_modules)
**/node_modules/
**/venv/
**/.expo/
**/.env/

# 6) Unignore a specific folder if a broader rule matched it
#!/backend/secret/keepme/
